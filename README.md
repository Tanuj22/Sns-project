# Sns-project

We are a making a project for signal and systems for our semester where we are supposed to use fourier transform and come up with
some project using it.

We have decided to make a software which takes in an audio signal and converts it to the voice of another person or another 
instrument depending upon the type of input audio signal

We will use various concepts to achive this,some of them are,
fourier transform
inverse fourier transform algorithm
dynamic time warping
